long term task:

  create relational database
    - create relational mappings for each word
    - Example: What it will look like:
      some hash value: {
        word:'text',

        surrounding_text_relations: [
          [surrounding text {given by SETTINGS.SEARCH PROXIMITY}]
        ],

        doubles : [
          [every two word combination, in order]
        ],

        triples : [
          [every three word combination, in order]
        ],

        quadruples: [
          [every four word combination, in order]
        ],

        quintuples: [
          [every five word combination, in order]
        ],

        filtered_text_relations: [
          [every single surrounding word that is also somewhere else in the page]
        ],
        
        possible_reccurent_phrases: [
          [go through all doubles, triples, quadruples, and quintuples and look for reoccurence]
        ],
